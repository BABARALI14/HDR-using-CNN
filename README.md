Handwritten digit recognition is very simply project you should try to understand the concept of how convolutional neural network works. In this tutorial, I have used Tensorflow and Tflearn to build a model. 
These are the steps covered in this course:
1. Collection of digits/images
2. Using that images to create data
3. Using that data to create model
4. Using that model to predict new digits

I have already made video on Handwritten digit recognition using SVC (Support Vector Classifier) and also I have converted my project into GUI (Graphical User Interface). If you are interested, Click on this link:
